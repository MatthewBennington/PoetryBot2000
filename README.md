This was the final project for Intro to CS taken in my freshman year.

I already have a decent grasp of programming, but not C++. So I decided to work on something fairly simple.

Poetry bot uses a bigram NLP model to parse and print text. It produces semi-legible text, which related to the source material.

The project is based off of a similar project (PoetryBot 1.0) completed last year for the "Sun Ra... Space Is The Place" class taught by Michael Wimberly.

PoetryBot 1.0 can be found here: https://github.com/MatthewBennington/Learning-Ruby/blob/master/ProbablyPoem.rb
